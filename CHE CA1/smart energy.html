                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>  In recent years, the global community has witnessed
                    an unprecedented surge in concerns regarding
                    energy consumption and its environmental repercus
                   sions. As the world grapples with the challenges of
                    climate change and strives toward sustainability, the
                    spotlight has turned to the domain of residential
                    energy management. Within this context, homes
                    emerge as pivotal arenas for intervention, given their
                    substantial contribution to overall energy consump
                   tion. Despite advancements in technology and grow
                   ing awareness regarding energy conservation,
                    traditional approaches to home energy (Aliero et al.,
                    2021; Hosseinian & Damghani, 2019) usage often  prove inadequate in addressing the intricacies of
                    modern living dynamics and personalized consump
                   tion patterns. Consequently, there exists a pressing
                    need for innovative solutions that can not only
                    monitor and regulate energy usage but also adapt
                    in real-time to the evolving needs (Fioretto et al.,
                    2017) and behaviors of homeowners.
                    The evolving landscape of residential energy man
                   agement is characterized by a confluence of factors,
                    including rapid technological advancements (Shareef
                    et al., 2020), increasing environmental consciousness,
                    and rising energy costs. These developments have
                    spurred a paradigm shift in how individuals interact
                    with their home energy systems, necessitating a  holistic and intelligent approach to energy manage
                    ment (Priyadarshini et al., 2022). Recognizing the lim
                    itations of conventional methodologies, there is a
                     growing impetus to develop integrated systems that
                     harness the power of emerging technologies such as
                     the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning
                     (ML) algorithms (Rashid et al., 2019; Vasudevan et al.,
                     2021).
                     Against this backdrop, this research paper seeks to
                     explore the design, development, and implementation
                     of a Smart Home Energy Management System
                     (SHEMS) that leverages IoT and ML technologies to
                     optimize energy consumption and promote sustain
                    able living practices. The SHEMS paper encompasses
                     a multifaceted approach aimed at monitoring, control
                    ling, and optimizing energy usage within residential
                     settings. Central to this endeavor is the utilization of a
                     diverse array of sensors, including but not limited to,
                     current and voltage sensors, temperature sensors, and
                     light sensors, to capture real-time data on energy
                     consumption and environmental parameters.
                     Furthermore, the integration of machine learning
                     algorithms, specifically the Gradient Boosting algo
                    rithm, adds a layer of intelligence to the SHEMS, ena
                    bling it to analyze complex datasets, detect patterns,
                     and make data-driven decisions regarding energy
                     optimization. By harnessing the power of ML, the
                     SHEMS can adapt to dynamic usage patterns, predict
                     future consumption trends, and identify opportunities
                     for energy savings. Moreover, the system’s ability to
                     detect and mitigate energy wastage in real-time
                     ensures efficient utilization of resources and contrib
                    utes to overall energy conservation efforts.
                     Smart homes often have an energy consumption
                     that is 10-30% lower than that of standard homes.
                     The decrease in energy use can be ascribed to the
                     utilization of intelligent thermostats, automatic light
                    ing, and energy monitoring systems
                     In essence, the SHEMS represents a pioneering
                     initiative in the field of residential energy manage
                    ment, offering a holistic and intelligent solution to
                     address the challenges of modern living. Through its
                     integration of IoT and ML technologies, coupled
                     with advanced sensor networks, the SHEMS promises
                     to revolutionize the way homeowners interact with
                     their energy systems, paving the way for a more sus
                    tainable and energy-efficient future  </p>
                <h3> Objectives</h3>
                <p>  The objectives of this research endeavor revolve
                    around the development and implementation of a
                    Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS)  that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) and
                    machine learning (ML) technologies to achieve several
                    key goals. Firstly, the system aims to monitor energy
                    consumption in real-time, leveraging a diverse array of
                    sensors to capture data on electricity usage, environ
                   mental parameters, and appliance behavior. Secondly,

                   tify patterns, predict future consumption trends, and
                    detect opportunities for energy savings. Additionally,
                    the system aims to empower homeowners with
                    greater control over their energy usage, providing
                    actionable insights and recommendations for improv
                   ing efficiency and reducing wastage. One of the pri
                   mary objectives for the system is to attain a
                    prediction accuracy of at least 95%, ensuring depend
                   able and efficient energy management while concur
                   rently reducing the RMSE and MAE. Finally, SHEMS

                   text of smart home energy management systems With the ever-growing demand for efficient energy
                   usage and the pressing need to mitigate environ
                  mental impact, researchers and practitioners are
                   increasingly turning to IoT-enabled solutions and
                   advanced ML algorithms to revolutionize the way
                   energy is monitored, controlled, and optimized
                   within residential settings. By synthesizing insights
                   from various studies, this survey spans topics such
                   as energy monitoring (Asare-Bediako et al., 2013;
                   Moore et al., 2019), wireless connectivity (Metering
                   et al., 2017), predictive maintenance, and user
                   engagement in similar research. It summarizes the
                   key findings, results, advantages, and drawbacks of
                   these studies, laying the foundation for the SHEMS
                   within the broader context of existing research.
                   Smart Home Energy Management System Based
                   on Artificial Intelligence (Ma et al., 2021) connects
                   users to the network. Smart terminals can read, pro
                  cess, and display home electricity, water, fault, and
                   other information to help people use electricity effi

                   Design and Implementation of a Smart Home
                   Energy Management System Using IoT and Machine
                   Learning (Hosseinian and Damghani, 2019) demon
                  strates energy management that can optimize the
                   energy use of smart homes. The system uses IoT
                   devices to collect real-time energy usage data and
                   machine learning to predict future energy usage pat
                  terns. This research work reports the use of deep
                   neural networks (DNN) to design and implement
                   smart home management systems (Shakeri et al.,
                   2020) with the help of IoT devices and machine
                   learning. The results of this work show that the sys
                  tem uses Karas (or TensorFlow) to train a DNN based
                   on energy data from IoT sensors. The system is used
                   for real-time monitoring with remote access to the  user interface. The system aims to reduce energy
                   costs and provide instant feedback to users.
                   Smart home and smart grid energy management
                   systems (Zhou et al., 2016) offer opportunities and
                   technologies to meet the high energy needs of the
                   expanding energy sector. One-third of electricity
                   demand is generated by the household sector.
                   Energy management is designed for the smart home
                   of the future. Smart homes will be able to control,
                   manage, and optimize their devices with minimal
                   human intervention. The ability of smart homes to
                   manage energy resources, including energy produc
                  tion and storage, is an important factor in the devel
                  opment of smart homes. This article provides
                   detailed information about new building manage
                  ment publications. Various devices and plugin elec
                  tric vehicle (EV) technologies used in smart home
                   systems are discussed, as well as different strategies.
                   Automatic optimal multi-energy management of
                   smart homes (Fiorini and Aiello, 2022) discovers
                   approximately 35% of carbon dioxide emissions in
                   industrialized countries come from residential and
                   commercial buildings. Improving building efficiency
                   and sustainability is therefore an important step
                   toward a low CO2 energy society. The key to achiev
                  ing sustainable development is to replace energy
                   sources with energy storage and technology to
                   improve the impact on the environment. Most stud
                  ies on building management focus on the economic
                   aspects of the building and ignore the environment.
                   It has also been stated that the concept of energy
                   flexibility is the ability to change demand over time
                   or limit demand as much as possible to reduce oper
                  ating costs. This research work offers a multi-energy,
                   multipurpose programming model to effectively
                   manage the supply, demand, and exchange of vari
                  ous energies based on dynamic prices and carbon
                   emissions. This article is a comprehensive and inte
                  grated research which includes 200 smart homes
                   with different heating and electrical equipment and
                   equipped with various smart technologies. The sys
                  tem’s effectiveness in reducing households’ carbon
                   footprint and rewarding consumers is evaluated
                   based on historical data and statistics from three
                   neighboring European countries.

                  ies, this research helps and solve energy manage
                  ment problems. The system reduces the energy
                   costs of a smart home or building through recom
                  mendations and predictions. This paper released a 5
                  layer system that collects data in real-time for the
                  management of building energy; identifies data pat
                  terns and adds them to recommendations to create
                   energy- saving strategies. The various sensors of the
                   concept architecture collect a lot of data. The archi
                  tecture consists of many layers, each dedicated to a
                   specific function. Using various pre-learning and
                   machine learning (ML) methods such as simple linear
                   regression (SLR), decision tree regression (DTR), ran
                  dom forest regression (RFR), K-nearest neighbor
                   regression (KNNR), and support vector regression
                   (SVR) for data analysis. This study shows that deci
                  sion tree regression (0.9999) and random forest
                   regression (0.9999) compare well with simple hori
                  zontal regression (0.9901), K-neighbor regression
                   (0.9720), and support vector regression (0.9966).
                   found that it performed. SLR (0.9900 and 0.0099),
                   DTR (0.0439 and 0.0019), RFR (0.0427 and 0.0018),
                   KNNR (0.0285 and 0.0018), KNNR (0.1690) and
                   RMSEERE 0.M. This research concluded that decision

                   Grid scheme to improve reliability of power systems
                   (Hartono et al., 2018) This paper envisions the devel
                  opment of intelligent homes fostering automated,
                   adaptable interactions between users and applian
                  ces, with a focus on optimizing electricity consump
                  tion. Evolving smart home applications (Shareef
                   et al., 2020), propelled by technological advance
                  ments and environmental regulations, aim to effi
                  ciently manage energy, curbing costs and enhancing
                   user comfort. At the paper’s core is a sophisticated
                   smart grid integrating AI and communication tech
                  nologies (Alimi & Ouahada, 2018; Zhou et al., 2016)
                   improving energy production efficiency and reduc
                  ing costs. Users actively participate through purpose
                  built
                   applications,

                   Home Energy
                   Management System (HEMS) apps, alongside
                   Demand Side Management (DSM) and Plugin Electric
                   Vehicle (PEV) initiatives, significantly boosting energy
                   efficiency in the smart grid. The research under
                  scores HEMS’ positive impact on reducing energy
                   loss and optimizing distribution within the smart
                   grid system.
                   The paper addresses the pressing global issue of
                   inefficient energy usage, particularly focusing on the
                   context of Malaysia where residential energy con
                  sumption is steadily rising due to population growth
                   and a lack of awareness regarding energy conserva
                  tion. Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) technol
                  ogy, the paper proposes a smart energy monitoring
                   system for home appliances (Rashid et al., 2019),
                   integrating Cognitive IoT (CIoT) principles. This sys
                  tem comprises a Raspberry Pi-based smart plug for
                   data collection, a Google Colab training server for
                   machine learning model development using
                   TensorFlow-based Long Short-term Memory (LSTM),
                   and a dashboard for real-time energy consumption
                   monitoring. The LSTM model achieves high accuracy,
                   surpassing 80%, with low mean squared error and
                   high R2 scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in
                   forecasting electricity consumption and detecting
                   abnormal energy usage patterns. This integrated
                   approach offers a promising solution for optimizing
                   energy management in residential settings.
                   The paper delves into the significance of the
                   Internet of Things (IoT) as a crucial data source for
                   data science technology, particularly in the realm of
                   energy consumption prediction for smart residential
                   buildings. Highlighting the importance of accurately
                   forecasting energy usage for sustainable urban
                   development, the study focuses on exploring deep
                   learning (Syamala et al., 2023) techniques for this
                   purpose. It emphasizes the critical role of optimal
                   window size in enhancing prediction performance
                   and model uncertainty estimation. Through its inves
                  tigation, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of
                   deep learning models in accurately estimating
                   household energy consumption patterns, making
                   them an optimal choice for predicting performance
                   and uncertainty in smart residential buildings.
                   The paper focuses on designing an effective
                   demand response (DR) program for smart homes to
                   optimize energy usage based on user preferences
                   (Chen et al., 2021). It introduces a multi objective
                   reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm that
                   improves upon conventional methods by addressing
                   user preference changes and uncertainties in future
                   pricing and renewable energy generation. The pro
                  posed algorithm utilizes two Q-tables to simultan
                  eously
                   consider

                   dissatisfaction, adapting appliance scheduling based
                   on previous experiences to achieve optimal results
                   swiftly. The algorithm’s high generalizability enables
                   its implementation in smart homes with diverse set
                  ups, including energy storage systems, renewable
                   energy sources, and various types of appliances.
                   Numerical analysis using real-world data demon
                  strates the algorithm’s ability to achieve significant
                   cost reductions (8.44%) while only marginally
                   increasing dissatisfaction levels (1.37%) on average,
                   even in the presence of price and renewable energy
                   uncertainty </p>
                <h3> Architecture of proposed system</h3>
                <p> The architecture diagram of the proposed Smart
                    Home Energy Management System (SHEMS)
                    depicted in Figure 1, embodies a comprehensive
                    framework that seamlessly integrates various compo
                   nents to enable effective monitoring, control, and
                    optimization of energy consumption in residential
                    environments.
                    At the core of the architecture lies the IoT sen
                   sors, strategically deployed throughout the home to
                    capture real-time data on energy usage, environ
                   mental conditions, and appliance operation. These
                    sensors, including current and voltage sensors, tem
                   perature sensors, light sensors, and others, serve as
                    the primary data sources for the SHEMS. After  collecting the data from the sensors, it is imported
                    into a .csv file for further processing and analysis.
                    The IoT gateway acts as a centralized hub respon
                   sible for aggregating data from the distributed sen
                   sors and transmitting it to the data preprocessing
                    and storage module. This module performs crucial
                    tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, and
                    aggregation to ensure the quality and integrity of
                    the data before storage. The energy management
                    system (EMS) component utilizes the pre-processed
                    data for feature extraction and data transformation,
                    extracting relevant insights and patterns related to
                    energy consumption and user behavior. These fea
                   tures are then fed into the machine learning infra
                   structure, which encompasses a range of algorithms
                    and models for predictive analytics and optimization.
                    The machine learning infrastructure employs
                    advanced techniques, including the Gradient Boosting
                    algorithm, to analyze historical data, forecast future
                    energy consumption, and identify optimization oppor
                   tunities. The Gradient Boosting algorithm captures
                    non-linear relationships and interactions between fea
                   tures and reduces overfitting issues. By continuously
                    learning from past data and adapting to changing
                    conditions, the system can dynamically adjust energy
                    consumption patterns to maximize efficiency and cost
                    savings. The energy consumption and optimization
                    module leverage the insights generated by the
                    machine learning models to implement real-time con
                   trol strategies, such as load shifting, demand
                    response, and appliance scheduling. These strategies
                    aim to minimize energy wastage, reduce peak
                    demand, and optimize energy usage based on user
                    preferences and environmental conditions.
                    The user interface component provides home
                   owners with intuitive dashboards and visualizations
                    to monitor energy usage, receive actionable recom
                   mendations, and interact with the system. Through a
                    user-friendly interface, homeowners can gain insights
                    into their energy consumption patterns, track cost
                    savings, and adjust settings to meet their energy
                    management goals.
                    Overall, the architecture diagram of SHEMS
                    embodies a holistic approach to smart home energy
                    management, leveraging IoT sensors, data preprocess
                   ing, machine learning, and user interface components
                    to create an intelligent system capable of optimizing
                    energy usage and promoting sustainability</p>

                   and user interaction aspects of the energy moni
                   toring system.
                    ZMPT101B voltage sensor: Working in tandem with
                    the current sensor, the ZMPT101B voltage sensor plays a
                    pivotal role in measuring the voltage levels in the house
                   hold. This dual-sensor approach ensures comprehensive
                    data for accurate calculations of power consumption. By
                    providing precise information on voltage, the sensor
                    contributes to the system’s ability to monitor and ana
                   lyze energy usage with a high degree of accuracy.

                    the breadboard serve as the physical backbone of
                    the system, providing a modular and organized
                    approach to circuit development. These components
                    facilitate the connection and prototyping of the cir
                   cuit, allowing for easy testing and iteration during
                    the developmental phase. Their modular nature
                    enhances the flexibility and scalability of the system,

                <h3> Proposed methodology</h3>
                <p> The methodology for deploying the ‘Smart Home
                    Management System using the Internet of Things’
                    (IoT) starts with a thorough literature review to  educate the researchers on best practices for energy
                    management based on the Internet of Things (IoT).
                    The hardware components defined by the architec
                   ture diagram are as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3
                    (ESP32 microcontroller), sensors and relay module,
                    and LDR will be purchased and integrated seamlessly.
                    Software development will focus on efficiency, secur
                   ity, and compatibility, using machine learning to ana
                   lyze the data and improve system intelligence. The
                    system’s intelligence will be augmented by integrat
                   ing environmental data from the DS18B20 tempera
                   ture sensor and LDR. Establishing communication
                    channels connecting the ESP32 to external platforms
                    will be a critical step, utilizing secure IoT protocols to
                    facilitate remote monitoring and control. To ensure
                    scalability, the system’s modular architecture will be
                    utilized to easily incorporate additional features and
                    sensors in the future</p>
                <h3> Data collection module</h3>
                <p>  The data collection module forms the foundation of
                    SHEMS, acquiring real-time data on energy con
                   sumption and environmental factors within the
                    household. Current and voltage sensors, such as the
                    ACS712 and ZMPT101B, capture precise measure
                   ments of energy usage, while additional sensors like
                    the DS18B20 temperature sensor and LDR (Light
                    Dependent Resistor) provide data on ambient tem
                   perature and light levels, respectively. These sensors
                    are interfaced with an ESP32 microcontroller, which
                    serves as the central processing unit for data acquisi
                   tion and initial preprocessing. Figure 4 demonstrates
                    the data collection phase. After collecting the data
                    collected from various sensors within the smart
                    home environment (e.g. ACS712 current sensor,
                    ZMPT101B voltage sensor, DS18B20 temperature
                    sensor, LDR) is cleaned and preprocessed. This
                    involves normalizing or standardizing the data to
                    ensure that all features are on a comparable scale,
                    facilitating better model performance. For handling
                    the missing data-Imputtaion techniques and
                    Interploation are applied. The outliers are removed
                    by using the Z-score and Interpolation techniques
                    are used.
                    The dataset is then divided into training and test
                   ing sets, typically using an 80-20 split. This means
                    that 80% of the data is used to train the models,
                    while the remaining 20% is reserved for testing. This
                    split is crucial for evaluating the model’s perform
                   ance on unseen data, thus providing an unbiased
                    assessment of its predictive capabilities </p>

                <h3> Machine learning model selection</h3>
                <p> After collecting the data from the sensors, it is
                    imported into a .csv file for further processing and
                    analysis. This step ensures that the data is organized
                    and accessible for various data manipulation and  modeling tasks. The .csv file serves as a structured
                    repository of the sensor data, enabling us to perform
                    data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model
                    training with the help of gradient boost algorithm.

                <p> management, a machine learning model is selected
                    to analyze consumption patterns, forecast future
                    demand, and recommend energy-saving strategies.
                    Considering the complexity and predictive require
                   ments of SHEMS, a Gradient Boosting Machine
                    (GBM) is chosen as the primary machine learning
                    model. GBMs offer high accuracy, robustness to
                    overfitting, and the ability to capture complex rela
                   tionships in the data, making them well-suited for
                    energy consumption optimization tasks</p>
                <h3> Model training and optimization</h3>
                <p>The selected GBM model undergoes training using
                    historical energy consumption data collected from
                    the household. Feature engineering techniques are
                    applied to extract relevant features from the raw
                    sensor data, including time of day, appliance usage
                    patterns, weather conditions, and occupancy status.
                    The model is trained to predict future energy
                    demand based on these features, optimizing for
                    accuracy and generalization performance through
                    techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross
                   validation.</p>
                <h4> Cross-validation method</h4>
                <p> To further enhance the reliability of the models and
                    reduce the risk of overfitting, cross-validation is
                    employed. Cross-validation involves partitioning the  training data into multiple subsets (folds) and train
                    ing the model multiple times, each time using a dif
                    ferent fold as the validation set.
                     K-Fold Cross-Validation: This method divides the
                     training data into K equal-sized folds. This compre
                    hensive evaluation ensures that every data point is
                     used for both training and validation, enhancing the
                     model’s robustness</p>
                <h4> Hyperparameter tuning</h4>
                <p> Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in optimiz
                    ing the performance of machine learning models. It
                     involves selecting the best set of hyperparameters
                     for the model, which are parameters set before the
                     training process begins.
                     Grid Search: An exhaustive search through a pre
                    defined set of hyperparameters. Each combination is
                     evaluated using cross-validation, and the combin
                    ation with the highest performance is selected.
                     For the Gradient Boosting model, hyperpara
                    meters such as the learning rate, number of estima
                    tors, and maximum depth of trees are tuned.
                     Random Search: Randomly samples combinations
                     of hyperparameters from the predefined space. This
                     method is more efficient for large hyperparameter
                     spaces.
                     Bayesian Optimization: Uses a probabilistic model
                     of the hyperparameter space to select the most
                     promising values iteratively. This advanced method efficiently
                     parameters.
                     For the Gradient Boosting model in SHEMS, the
                     tuning process involved:

                     3.
                     Defining the Search Space: Learning rate (e.g.
                     0.01, 0.1), number of estimators (e.g. 100, 200,
                     300), and maximum depth (e.g. 3, 5, 7).
                     Performing Cross-Validation: Evaluating each
                     combination using K-fold cross-validation to
                     ensure robust generalization.
                     Selecting the Best Hyperparameters: Choosing
                     the combination that achieved the highest
                     cross-validation score.

                     fðxi , yiÞgn
                     i¼1, where xi represents input features (e.g.
                     sensor data) and yi represents the corresponding tar
                    get variable (energy consumption), the objective is
                     to learn a predictive model FðxÞ that accurately pre
                    dicts energy consumption based on input features.
                     The general algorithm for Gradient Boosting, tail
                    ored to our paper’s needs, can be outlined as
                     follows:

                <h3> Conclusion and future enhancements</h3>
                <p> In summary, the Smart Home Energy Management
                    System (SHEMS) outlined in this study offers a robust
                    framework for enhancing energy efficiency and cost
                   effectiveness in residential environments. Through the
                    fusion of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and
                    machine learning algorithms, SHEMS empowers
                    homeowners with real-time insights into energy con
                   sumption patterns, enabling informed decisions for
                    conservation and savings. Leveraging the Gradient
                    Boosting algorithm ensures precise forecasting of
