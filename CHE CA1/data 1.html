            <h2>Global Smart Energy Management Market Growth</h2>
            <p>The global smart energy management market was valued at $25.45 billion in 2022, with an expected CAGR of 23.4%, reaching $162.2 billion by 2030. The market is driven by the need for energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, and decarbonization goals.</p>
            <p>Regions such as North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific are leading the adoption of smart energy technologies, with North America holding the largest share of the market.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="demand-response">
            <h2>Demand Response & Load Management</h2>
            <p>Demand response (DR) programs are growing in popularity, with 35% of U.S. households participating in DR programs to shift energy usage during peak times. In 2022, the demand response capacity in the U.S. increased by 5.8 GW, helping to stabilize the grid.</p>
            <p>The global DR market is expected to grow to $21 billion by 2028, thanks to increasing participation in residential and commercial sectors.</p>

        <section id="renewables">
            <h2>Renewable Energy Integration</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy accounted for 38% of global electricity generation in 2022 and is expected to rise to 50% by 2030. Smart energy management systems help integrate solar, wind, and battery storage to ensure grid stability, with 70% of energy companies investing in smart grids for better renewable energy integration.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="consumer-engagement">
            <h2>Consumer Engagement & Smart Metering</h2>
            <p>Smart meters are being rolled out globally, with 50% of households already equipped with them as of 2022. Consumers can track their real-time energy consumption, saving 5â€“15% on their energy bills. Smart thermostats like Nest and Ecobee also help households save on heating and cooling costs.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="ai-in-energy">
            <h2>AI in Energy Management</h2>
            <p>AI is transforming energy management by predicting demand, optimizing grid operations, and improving fault detection. The market for AI in energy management is expected to grow from $2.1 billion in 2022 to $12.6 billion by 2030.</p>
            <p>AI-driven platforms like Grid Edge and AutoGrid help forecast energy demand and optimize energy distribution from both traditional and renewable sources.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="ev-integration">
            <h2>Electric Vehicle (EV) Integration & Smart Charging</h2>
            <p>The global EV market grew by 65% in 2023, with EV sales expected to make up 40% of total car sales by 2030. Smart charging stations are becoming integral to the EV ecosystem, helping to optimize charging times and balance grid load.</p>
            <p>Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is also emerging, allowing EVs to return energy to the grid when not in use. In 2023, 20,000 V2G-capable EVs were deployed globally, and the number is expected to rise in the coming years.</p>
