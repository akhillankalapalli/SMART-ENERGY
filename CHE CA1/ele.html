    <section id="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The term Industry 4.0, which refers to the fourth industrial revolution, was introduced
            in an initiative of the German government [1,2]. This is a paradigm shift driven by various
            technological advancements that is reshaping how the manufacturing industry operates.
            It has enormous potential to enhance sustainability and energy efficiency and reduce the
            environmental impact of manufacturing. It also offers financial incentives to manufacturers
            such as the promise of improved cost efficiency and product quality.
            Since its introduction in 2011, Industry 4.0 has been one of the most highly researched
            topics in the scientific community. Some of its technological components such as Internet of
            Things (IoT), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Augmented and Virtual
            Reality, etc., have been at the top of the hype cycle of emerging technologies during this
            period [3] and have received the attention of the industry as well as academia [4–6]. These
            technologies facilitate Smart Manufacturing by enabling a high degree of interconnection of physical assets, digital tools and human operators [7]. The over-arching goal is to enable
            advanced optimisation and control, automated performance monitoring, decision-making
            and seamless communication across the production floor.
            A comprehensive study spanning almost 750 German manufacturing companies found
            that the various drivers of this paradigm shift include not only strategic and operational
            incentives for the companies but environmental and social factors as well [8]. Some of
            these strategic and operational incentives include increased flexibility, reduced time-tomarket
            and optimised resource utilisation. Decision making is supported by real-time data
            analytics ensuring that the organisation can maintain a competitive edge. On the other hand,
            environmental factors include reduction in the energy consumption and carbon footprint.
            Plans for Industry 5.0, such as the European Commission’s white paper [9], are already
            in development, which integrate a human-centred approach. However, evidence of Industry
            4.0 implementation is scarce, and this concept is still in “the blue sky” phase [10]. There
            have been comprehensive literature reviews on the technological as well as managerial
            barriers [10,11] to the implementation of Industry 4.0. Each and every industrial implementation
            case has its unique problems, and bespoke solutions are required to overcome them.
            This paper is focused on the approach taken to deliver and deploy a configurable
            Industry 4.0 solution to address specific needs for a leading medical device manufacturer.
            The basis of this is driven by the EU DENiM project [12], which brings together an interdisciplinary
            team to develop a modular digital intelligence platform. The DENiM solution
            enables the manufacturing sector to manage manufacturing systems in an energy efficient
            manner through systematic requirements analysis, data management, modelling and
            decision support tools.
            The main requirements and interests as well as the unique strengths and weaknesses
            of the company were understood at the outset of the project, and a pathway to achieve the
            business objectives was charted. This paper describes the trajectory from a state of minimal
            digitalisation to a customised Industry 4.0 solution.
            The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides some background
            information and gives a high-level overview of the production process. The project implementation
            plan and the main functional blocks to be implemented are discussed. The following
            sections then elaborate on each of the functional blocks of the implementation.
            Each of them enumerates the challenges as well as the solutions used to overcome them.
            As energy efficiency was one of the key interests of this project, Section 3 is dedicated to
            the discussion of energy-centric data analytics and predictive models of the production
            assets. This section also discusses the application of these models in production planning
            and anomaly detection. Any production site is supported by auxiliary services such as
            HVAC systems—both for maintaining indoor air quality as well as providing chilled water
            and compressed air for critical production processes. These systems are prone to faults
            that lead to energy and cost inefficient operation. Therefore, automated fault detection and
            diagnosis was a key consideration; it is described in Section 4. This production facility also
            houses onsite renewable energy assets in the form of wind turbines and a solar PV unit.
            Optimising the energy from these sources was an important objective of this project, which
            is discussed in Section 5. A context-driven user interface for advanced energy analytics as
            well as an extended reality environment that provides an immersive experience for the user
            are described in Section 6. Section 7 highlights the positive impacts of this implementation
            on business operations by discussing the achievements against each of the performance
            targets. Finally, Section 8 summarises the paper and lists the potential for further work at
            this production facility.</p>

    <section id="Background">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>This section begins with a brief introduction of the production process, identifying
            the key assets within the scope of the project. We then give a brief overview of the
            project plan, including the specific targets as well as the functional blocks comprising the
            Industry 4.0 implementation. The production facility located in Cork, Ireland, is split over two separate buildings.
            The facility produces various medical products that are classified into different product
            families based on their application. A schematic of the of the facility is given in Figure 1.</p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-11-17 153449.png">
        <p>Many of these product types are medical implants manufactured from ultra-highmolecular-
            weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Although there are variations across each
            product, the overall production process can be boiled down into the eight steps shown in
            Figure 2 and described below:
            1. Issue Material: the raw material is allocated to each of the product families. Operators
            use printers and barcode scanners to enable tracking.
            2. Saw: The material undergoes processing in machine saws to obtain blocks of the
            required size for each product family.
            3. Machine: The individual blocks are processed using Computer Numerical Control
            (CNC) machines to obtain the finished product.
            4. Inspect: The products are inspected for compliance and defective ones are scrapped.
            Various machines are used during this stage.
            5. Clean: The products are cleaned and sterilised in a multi-stage cleanline. The stages
            include water-baths as well as air-dryers. The parameters such as temperature, flowrate,
            pH, etc., are tightly controlled.
            6. Label: Each product is assigned labels.
            7. Package: The products are sealed and packaged.
            8. Ship: The products are shipped from the facility.</p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-11-17 153726.png">
            <p>The devices and assets considered within the scope of this project can broadly be
                classified into three categories:
                1. Production Specific Assets: this category includes all the machine tools and devices
                that are directly involved in the production process such as electric saws, CNC
                machines, cleanlines, and sealing and packaging equipment.
                2. Production Support Assets: this includes the auxiliary assets that are not directly
                involved in the production process but nevertheless serve other critical aplications. Examples
                include Air Handling Units (AHUs), chilled water system, and air compressors.
                3. Renewable Energy Assets: this category includes the wind turbines, photovoltaic
                panels and other assets that provide the facility with alternate sources of electricity.
                Table 1 gives a description of the various assets involved at each step of the production
                process. The table also gives information about the status of energy monitoring of each
                category of assets. As can be seen from the table, only the cleanline machines are equipped
                with energy sensors.</p>

            <h4>Project Plan</h4>
            <p>When it comes to the actual implementation, Industry 4.0 is an open-ended concept
                and does not prescribe specific guidelines [13]. Instead, manufacturing companies need
                to focus on their specific needs when prioritising the implementation of Industry 4.0
                technologies [14]. In our case study, the overarching aim of the Industry 4.0 solution was to
                enhance not only individual efficiency but also the integration of the various assets across
                the three categories mentioned above. A key focus area of this implementation was to
                monitor and improve energy efficiency.
                An effective implementation of Industry 4.0 goes beyond simply upgrading the technologies;
                some of the critical success factors identified in a case study [15] include the
                involvement of top management leadership; project planning; conducting preparatory
                activities; the establishment of inter-functional teams; continuous development; and lean
                management. In a nutshell, Industry 4.0 is not just about technology; it encompasses
                all business activities and impacts all organisational units within a company. Given this
                context, a systematic procedure derived from the HyDAPI [16] methodology was used.
                This methodology is a hybrid of lean management principles and data-driven modelling
                techniques that aims to aid organisations in their transition to Industry 4.0. This methodology
                was also validated on real-world case studies, and, therefore, recognises and addresses
                the practical challenges that arise in these contexts. For this research, seven steps were
                adapted and reformulated from the HyDAPI methodology (Figure 3), with the overarch ing aim of streamlining the tasks and ensuring all targets are achieved. These stages are
                described below:
                Figure</p>
                <img src="Screenshot 2024-11-17 154318.png">
            <p>1. Project Charter: a project charter was created using the template shown in Figure 4.
                This identified all the stakeholders, including, business management, production
                engineers, utilities technicians, research partners, and representatives within the
                funding agency. The key tasks were identified and assigned. Additionally, the project
                management aspects were also included.
                2. Process Overview: the high-level view of the production process is shown in Figure 2.
                The intricate details of the process were discussed through several meetings, some of
                which were held at the facility. The research partners were also given the opportunity
                to shadow production engineers to better understand the process.
                3. Business Requirements Specification: High-level meetings with the management
                were held to formulate the business requirements. Three broad areas were identified,
                which are described below, and the associated metrics are shown in Table 2.
                • Digitalisation: Monitoring assets in real-time as well as equipping them with
                data-driven decision support systems.
                • Energy Efficiency: improving energy efficiency by optimising operation or
                detecting and addressing faults. This aspect also includes the optimisation of
                renewable energy sources available at the facility.
                • Cost/Energy Savings: The above two will lead to savings in terms of electricity
                consumption as well as cost.
                These requirements were then translated into functional blocks, which are defined as
                the individual modules of the Industry 4.0 solution, whose coordinated operation will
                fulfil the business requirements. The different functional blocks are described later in
                this section.
                4. Data Catalogue: A data catalogue with a high-level overview of all the data sources
                was developed as shown in Table 3. This also identifies the personnel responsible for
                maintaining the datasets.
                5. Data Architecture: This step delves into the details of each data source. While some
                data points correspond to physical assets, others reflect overall aggregates coming
                from a higher level of abstraction.
                6. Data Assessment: A detailed data assessment was carried out for each of the asset
                types identified in the data catalogue. The minimum data requirements for each of the
                functional blocks were listed. For instance, for the production assets, energy sensors
                are theminimumrequirement. The details of eachwill be given in the respective sections. 7. Connection Plan: from the above six steps, it emerged that the minimum data
                requirements were not fulfilled for most of the functional blocks. In some cases,
                the assets were not equipped with sensors, whereas in others, the data were being
                collected but not stored on the site’s data historian. One of the key steps taken
                was the installation of energy meters on most of the production assets. As can be
                seen in Table 2, having 85% of the production assets equipped with real-time energy
                monitoring capabilities was one of the concrete targets of this project.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="Data Analysis">
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>The two datasets have different temporal resolutions—the energy data are available
            at one-minute resolution, whereas the number of production log entries depends on the
            number of product batches processed during any given shift. There are two shifts of twelve
            hours within a 24-h period: 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and, 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Thus, the first step
            in the data analysis was to obtain shift-wise aggregates of the energy consumption and
            production details. An example of the resampled and aggregated data is shown in Figure 5.
            It is immediately clear from the data that idling energy is a significant proportion of the
            total. For instance, in rows 1 and 4 of the sample dataset, even when a single unit is
            produced there is a considerable amount of energy consumed within that shift.</p>
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-11-17 154927.png">
        <h2>Idling Energy</h2>
        <p>One of the main targets of this project was to monitor energy consumption and identify
            potential for idle energy reduction. In the literature, idling power is defined as the energy
            consumption of a machine when it is powered on but not performing the actual machining
            operation. However, in this case, as the process data are not available, it is not possible to
            estimate the idling energy. Analysis of the data showed that the assets were being powered
            on even during shifts with no production. The overall energy consumption during that
            shift is considered as idling energy in this context as it is unnecessary energy consumption
            and presents a potential for saving. It was also found that for a large number of shifts,
            a small number of products were being manufactured. Apart from idle energy, we also
            quantify the energy being consumed in shifts where the production output is less than
            five and less than ten. The overall energy efficiency could be improved by optimising
            the production schedule. The results from the analysis are reported in Figure 6, where
            the terms ‘Idle 5’ and ‘Idle 10’ refer to shifts with less than five and ten units produced,
            respectively. The aggregates over various categories of assets are presented in Table 4.
            For instance, for the lathes over 71% of the total energy is being consumed in shifts with
            less than 10 units produced. Thus, there is a tremendous energy savings potential that can
            be realised by implementing idle time reduction and schedule optimisation. It is worth
            mentioning that this was uncovered from simple data analysis, despite the lack of detailed
            process data. The true potential of idle energy savings could be even higher if data were
            available at a finer resolution.</p>

    <section id="Energy Models">
        <h2>Energy Models</h2>
        <p>One of the main objectives of this Industry 4.0 project was to improve the energy
            efficiency of the high energy consuming production assets. However, as mentioned in the
            previous subsections, there are a couple of data availability and quality issues. Firstly, there
            are no data on the process parameters that are directly related to the energy consumption.
            Furthermore, the production data are logged at variable intervals throughout the shifts.
            The data have to be resampled to get shift-wise aggregates of energy and production.
            As there are only two variables available, linear regression was chosen as the method for
            analysis. As mentioned before, there are various product families that are produced in
            this facility, and each one has a different machining procedure. Thus, they have different
            amounts of energy required during machining. For the assets in consideration in this
            case study, the Saws and Cleanlines were used for multiple product families. However,
            the lathes were dedicated to a single product. There were only a few lathes that were
            used for multiple products, but they were used during separate shifts. These datapoints
            where different products were produced in the same shift were removed before carrying
            out the analysis. The dataset for modelling therefore consists of the production and energy
            consumption information segregated by product type. We develop regression models for
            each of the machines for specific product types.
            A sample result from the analysis is shown in Figure 7, the subfigures of which show
            (a) a scatterplot of energy consumption and production, (b) shift-wise production output
            for the particular product, and (c) prediction of energy consumption overlaid on the actual
            values. It can be seen that the models predict energy consumption with reasonable accuracy.
            This can be used in two applications:
            1. Production Planning: the model aids production planning by providing an estimate
            of the energy required to produce a given number of units of a certain type of product
            within a shift
            2. Anomaly Detection: as can be seen in Figure 7, the model also flags some anomalous
            energy consumption patterns that might be caused due to tool wear or faults in the
            auxiliary machine systems. Thus, the model can also serve as a fault detection tool.</p>

        <h2>Fault Detection And Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Over time, mechanical equipment undergoes degradation leading to deviations from
            the normal behaviour. If left unchecked, this deviation may worsen, leading to the equipment’s
            inability to achieve its desired function, resulting in downtime. This deviation
            from the standard condition is known as a fault [17], and the identification and root cause
            analysis of its occurrence is the focus of the area of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD).
            While FDD is key to identifying the early signs of equipment failure, it is also a means of
            identifying inefficient energy consumption, especially in the case of Heating Ventilation and
            Air-Conditioning (HVAC) equipment. For example, Air Handling Units (AHUs) provide
            fresh and thermally comfortable air to manufacturing spaces. During normal operation,
            AHUs leverage damper and valve positions to provide the required amount of airflow
            at the appropriate temperature. However, a faulty valve position may lead to excessive
            heating or cooling of the air, and to ensure it meets the requirements of the room, the AHU
            will compensate for the fault. As the AHU is still capable of performing its desired function,
            this energy-wasting fault may go unnoticed. This is a significant issue in HVAC equipment
            as unnoticed faults may account for up to 20% of energy consumed [18]. Therefore, the
            early detection and diagnosis of hidden faults is a key energy conservation measure.
            The Industry 4.0 paradigm brings new tools and approaches that can detect these
            hidden faults, but they may not yet be applicable in a practical setting. Many different types
            of data-driven algorithms have been successfully applied to FDD problems, as outlined
            in multiple systematic reviews of the landscape [19–22]. However, in [21] it was reported
            that about 65% of these studies utilise datasets from experiments in a laboratory setting
            such as those in [23,24]. The obvious issue that arises here is that these approaches would
            not be applicable if the same data quality and quantity are absent in the practical setting.
            Therefore, domain expertise plays a major role in FDD.
            The main production support assets at this facility include AHUs, chillers, and air
            compressors. However, a limited number of data were available for the chilled water
            system and air compressors. Therefore, at this stage we only considered the AHUs. As mentioned above, the production facility consists of two large buildings, each
            of which is served by several Air Handling Units (AHUs). AHUs are one of the most
            important components of the HVAC system of a building, and the literature is full of FDD
            methods for AHUs [21]. However, there are various data availability and quality issues
            when it comes to real-world application. One of the reliable approaches, the Air Handling
            Unit Performance Assessment Rules (APAR), is an expert systems approach introduced by
            House et al. [25]. Only eleven data points are required to implement this ruleset. Moreover,
            it solely depends on the current data sample and therefore does not depend on the sampling
            interval, nor does it require one to store previous data. Some sample rules are shown in
            Table 5. Whenever a rule evaluates to true, it indicates the presence of some fault as the
            AHU is deviating from expected behaviour.</p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-11-17 155748.png">
            <p>The APAR ruleset was implemented on four AHUs, for which data are available.
                To evaluate the potential impact of the FDD tool, data for the year 2022 were analysed.
                The AHU was considered to be in faulty operation when the data triggered any rule.
                In particular, the faults such as stuck dampers, passing coils, etc. which cause excessive
                energy consumption, were considered. The energy consumption during faulty operation
                was computed and compared against the normal operation. As an example, the energy
                consumption of one of the AHUs is shown in Figure 8, which captures the difference
                between the normal operation and operation under the damper stuch fault.</p>

    <section id="Renewable Integration">
        <h2>Renewable Integration</h2>
        <p>The lower costs of the technologies employed by renewable energy sources (RES) make
            their implementation in the industry more attractive, to supply the energy consumption of
            the electricity grid, taking advantage of renewable sources in the generation of electricity.
            Industries are increasingly opting for RES integration in their various production processes.
            The implementation and optimisation of RES allow one to increase the production profits
            as well as minimise the consumption of energy produced by fossil fuels.
            The aim of this tool is to minimise costs and emissions by maximising the use of
            renewable energy in the production process. For this purpose, a strategy based on a
            supervisory controller has been designed, using Model-Based Predictive Control (MPC).
            This control algorithm is based on the calculation of a real-time optimisation of a functional,
            where dynamic models of all generation and demand assets are considered. The schematic
            diagram of the microgird at the site can be seen in Figure 9.
            </p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-11-17 160154.png">
            <p>This scheme of the manufacturing plant can be considered as a microgrid with the
                following assets:
                • Renewable energy sources: there is a wind turbine and a solar plant in this factory.
                • Battery bank (B). Store energy and discharge when it is needed.
                • Combined Heat and Power (CHP). Produced energy and heat from gas.
                • Remaining consumption: all consumption that cannot be manipulated. It is about 90%
                of the total.
                • Manipulable demand as a group of CNCs.
                All these assets have been modelled in order to be able to control them within the
                MPC. In particular, more accurate models have been developed for the RESs as these are
                the energy sources to be maximised. The developed models can be found in [26], together
                with all the in-depth development of this tool. Only the models implemented for the
                RESs, the high-level development of the tool and some of the results obtained will be
                shown below.</p>
